 ~Message~
Running our backend requires a firebase authorization file, called `server/dbauth.json`,
and an api key for google maps at `server/apiKey.txt`,
message @CelestialTater#8112 on discord or email coledewis@gmail.com to obtain these.
Then simply run `python3 main.py` in the backend directory.

If you do decide to run the backend yourself, change line 11 in `client/src/App.js` from
`const socket = new WebSocket("wss://sparse.ben1jen.software/ws/"); // connect to backend server`
 to
`const socket = new WebSocket("localhost:7030"); // connect to backend server`

Running the client requires nodejs and npm (usually they come packaged together).
In the `client` directory, run `npm install`, then `npm start`.
Your browser should open up with the app, if not, go to `127.0.0.1:3000`.

To build the cordova app you need to install android studio.
You can check if cordova and android studio are set up correctly with `cordova requirements`
Then you need to (in the client directory) run:
`cordova platform add android`, then
`cordova build android`.

 ~Dependencies~

**ATTENTION** Python and pip things are only needed if you decide to run the backend yourself.

npm+node: Get from nodejs.org
python3: Get from python.org

npm packages: installed with `npm install` in the client directory

Cordova requires android studio to build the android app, run `cordova requirements` to see if it's set up correctly

pip packages: (install with `pip3 install package`)
